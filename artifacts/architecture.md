# Initial Architectural Description
Our website will provide the user with a user interface so they can login and and signup for our website. They can browse a list of group chats to join and once they join a group chat they have the option of sending and receiving messages in the group chat. Our website will use Firebase to quarry information to be displayed to the user depending on which group chat the user wants to participate in. Firebase will handle most of our data as well as the user login and logout system. Our website will constantly communicate with our firebase in many different ways such as to keep the chat updated, update the group chat list, handle login and logout, and etc.

# Data Design

If you are using a database, you should have a basic Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) in this section. This diagram should describe the tables in your database and their relationship to one another (especially primary/foreign keys), including the columns within each table. 

See Code Complete, Chapter 3

# Business Rules

You should list the assumptions, rules, and guidelines from external sources that are impacting your program design. 

See Code Complete, Chapter 3

# User Interface Design

You should have one or more user interface screens in this section. Each screen should be accompanied by an explaination of the screens purpose and how the user will interact with it. You should relate each screen to one another as the user transitions through the states of your application. You should also have a table that relates each window or component to the support using stories.
