# UCF COP_4331 Project (ChatUnlimited)

# Product Vision Statement

This product is a webapp created for realtime chat interactions betweeen users interested in similar topics and discussions.
Unlike other websites, our plan is to make our web app more appealing and unique by embracing openness of the discussions 
and availability to join any group chat. This is opposed to other competitors like discord where an invitation is often 
required to join a server. It differs from reddit in the more lax and personal “group-chat” type atmosphere it will 
provide in an unmoderated fashion. This lax and quick discussion style with interest groups is our main selling point.
Other feautures include private discussion availability and subgroups for discussions. Groups that are looking for quick 
group chat functionality and communities of people who just chat about similar topics/subjects will enjoy our webapp.
